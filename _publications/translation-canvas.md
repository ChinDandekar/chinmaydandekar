Translation Canvas is an advanced explainable interface designed for machine translation researchers to deeply analyze and compare the performance of various translation models. It serves as a sophisticated tool that not only highlights common errors within translations but also facilitates instance-level and system-level performance evaluations. By offering intuitive visualizations and powerful analytical capabilities, Translation Canvas helps users pinpoint specific weaknesses in translation models, enabling more informed model improvements.
