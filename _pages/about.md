Hello! I am Chinmay Dandekar, a senior at University of California, Santa Barbara. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at the [College of Creative Studies](https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu), an honors college at UC Santa Barbara.

Currently  I am applying to *PhD* programs in **computer science** starting *Fall 2025*. I am interested in researching techniques to improve performance of multilingual Large Language Models in low-resource languages, with the goal of making large language models accessible to users who don't speak English. Check out my **[CV](/chinmaydandekar/files/CV.pdf)** and some of my **[projects and research](/chinmaydandekar/projects)**.

In my free time, I like to play badminton, try out Pokémon strategies and restaurant hop in San Francisco with my friends. Here is a picture of some amazing cofee that we got at [Pixlcat Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sF1ZF2RAX6VBkfwq7) in SF recently:
